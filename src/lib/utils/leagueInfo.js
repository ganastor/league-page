  <p>Founded in 2022, the All Elite Dynasty league began as a Dynasty leage with 12 members.</p>
  <p>Some managers built immediate win-now teams, while others began the slow process of building a juggernaut dynasty team. A portion of the league prioritized youth and draft picks, the rest gravitated towards the steadfast value of veterans. While some managers fled from injuries and down years, others bought the dip and built for the future.</p>
  <p>White the ultimate prize is bragging rights and sending obnoxious messages tot he rest of the league for the next year, the champion also walks away with $1400.</p>
